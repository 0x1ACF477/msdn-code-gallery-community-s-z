<p><span style="font-size:small">Tetris (Russian: &laquo;Тетрис&raquo;, pronounced [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching puzzle video game, originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer&nbsp;Alexey Pajitnov.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov]
 It was released on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing&nbsp;Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces&nbsp;contain four
 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:small">This is a .Net version of Tetris, that uses two extended DataGridViews, one as the falling blocks game board and one for the shapes preview, alongsidethe game board.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:small">During game play, you can rotate the falling blocks clock-wise by pressing the UP arrow button, or anti clock-wise by pressing Shift and the UP arrow.LEFT and RIGHT arrow buttons move the current shape left or right, and the DOWN
 arrow button increases the speed of descent.&nbsp;As you form complete rows on the bottom of the game board, those rows flash several times before disappearing, and your score (displayed in a label&nbsp;to the right of the game board) is incremented. As you
 progress in the game, the speed of descent of the falling shapes increases as you make morefull rows.</span></p>
