<h1>Work with early bound entity classes in code</h1>
<p>In Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online &amp; on-premises), the code generation tool (CrmSvcUtil) creates early-bound entity classes that you can use to access business data in Microsoft Dynamics 365. These classes include one class for each entity in your installation,
 including custom entities. Each time you make customizations to your system, you must regenerate these classes. The classes can be used in any project type or built into a class library. You can use early-bound entity classes when creating applications that
 use Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as plug-ins and custom workflow activities. For more information about using the code generation tool, see
<a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Work-with-early-bound-6914f6e7/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/org-service/create-early-bound-entity-classes-code-generation-tool">
Create early bound entity classes with the code generation tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)</a>.</p>
<p>The advantages to using early-bound entity classes is that all type references are checked at compile time. The compiled executable contains the code necessary to invoke the types&rsquo; properties, methods, and events. For more information, see
<a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Work-with-early-bound-6914f6e7/https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Work-with-early-bound-6914f6e7/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/org-service/use-early-bound-entity-classes-create-update-delete">
Use the early-bound entity classes for create, update, and delete</a>.</p>
<p>The class created by the code generation tool includes all the entity&rsquo;s attributes and relationships. By using the class in your code, you can access these attributes and be type safe. A class with attributes and relationships is created for all entities
 in your organization. There is no difference between the generated types for system and custom entities.</p>
