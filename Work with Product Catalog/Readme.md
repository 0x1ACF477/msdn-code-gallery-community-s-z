<h1>Work with Product Catalog</h1>
<p>A product catalog is a collection of products with their pricing information. The<span>&nbsp;</span><em>product catalog</em><span>&nbsp;</span>entities let you create a rich product classification system in Microsoft Dynamics 365 that provides support for:</p>
<ul class="unordered">
<li>
<p>Defining hierarchical structure of product families and products with configurable properties (attributes) that help you reduce the number of product stock keeping units (SKUs) needed to maintain your product catalog.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Selling individual products or grouping them into bundles and kits. A bundle or a kit is a collection of products that is sold as single unit. Product bundling is useful in grouping products in a way that customers get more benefit from the full line of
 products or to offer discounts on bundled products.</p>
</li></ul>
