<p><em>This is real time chat application, with option to chat with multiple users.</em></p>
<p><em>This can be treated as a sample to develope an enterprise chat/ chat rooms application, also this can be treated as a sample to organize our hubs and angular js code for simple applications and a simple way to use signalr and angular js together.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used signalr and angular js to to provide real time communication. Both Singnalr and Angular JS are awsome technologies at there place.<span>SignalR can be used to add any sort of &quot;real-time&quot; web functionality to your ASP.NET application ,provides&nbsp;<span>simple
 API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC) that call JavaScript functions in client browsers (and other client platforms) from server-side .NET code. SignalR also includes API for connection management (for instance, connect and disconnect
 events), and grouping connections.</span></span>&nbsp;Signalr make the task of two-way communication with server easier, Angular JS&nbsp;<span>automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding</span></p>
