<p>This tutorial illustrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create custom activities using both composition and code </li><li>How to create State Machine, Flowchart, and Sequential workflows </li><li>How to host workflows using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.activities.workflowapplication.aspx">
WorkflowApplication</a> </li><li>How to create a persistence database and host long running workflows </li><li>How to create a custom TrackingParticipant </li><li>How to use WorkflowIdentity to host multiple versions of a workflow side-by-side
</li><li>How to use Dynamic Update to modify the definition of a running workflow instance
</li></ul>
<p>Step 1, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489453(VS.110).aspx">
How to: Create an Activity</a>, demonstrates how to create a simple activity by using code to implement its execution logic and an activity whose implementation is defined by using other activities.</p>
<p>Step 2, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489437(VS.110).aspx">
How to: Create a Workflow</a>, demonstrates how to create a workflow using either a Flowchart workflow, a Sequential workflow, or a State Machine workflow, using built-in activities and the custom activities from the first step in the tutorial.</p>
<p>Step 3, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489463(VS.110).aspx">
How to: Run a Workflow</a>, demonstrates how to host a workflow using&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.activities.workflowapplication.aspx">WorkflowApplication</a>. It shows how to pass data into a workflow when starting the workflow,
 how to retrieve data from a completed workflow, and how to pass data into a running workflow using bookmarks.</p>
<p>Step 4, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489452.aspx">How to: Create and Run a Long Running Workflow</a>, demonstrates how to configure a workflow persistence database, and how to host a long running workflow in a Windows Forms host.</p>
<p>Step 5, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205426.aspx">How to: Create a Custom Tracking Participant</a>, demonstrates how to create a custom tracking participant that is used to display status about the progress of the workflow in the host
 application.</p>
<p>Step 6,<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205425.aspx"> How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side</a>, demonstrates how to use the new versioning features in WF45 to host multiple versions of a workflow side-by-side in the
 same host application.</p>
<p>Step 7, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205427.aspx">How to: Update the Definition of a Running Workflow Instance</a>, demonstrates how to use Dynamic Update to update the definition of a running workflow instance.</p>
