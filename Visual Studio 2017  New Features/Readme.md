Feeling great &amp; Looking Smart. I know every one is excited for the new release of
<em>&quot;Visual Studio 2017&quot;</em>. Yes , Microsoft Visual Studio celebrated it&rsquo;s 20th years of glory with all tech lovers in the world love it. Now, it has come up with lots of excitement. Thus, I am happy to share the important features of Visual Studio
 2017 with all the tech lovers.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h1>Features in Visual Studio 2017</h1>
<p><br>
The following are the new features in Visual Studio 2017.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Live Unit Testing</h2>
<p><br>
This feature is only available in Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise edition. Without running the solution, we can easily test the Application because few hidden background process happens in our Application through
<em>&quot;Live Unit Testing&quot;</em>. We can enable Live Unit Testing for which you need to go to the
<em>&quot;Test&quot;</em> command of the top-level menu bar in VS, choose &quot;Live Unit Testing&quot;, then &quot;Start&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
We noticed that 3 symbols appeared in our code due to running on background Live Testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross Sign</strong> &ndash; line of executable code. The test is covered and it indicates that a failure test.
</li><li><strong>Tick Mark</strong> &ndash; line of executable code. The test is covered and it indicates that a success test.
</li><li><strong>Minus</strong> &ndash; line of executable code. Not yet covered a single Test.
</li></ul>
<h2>Dotted Line</h2>
<p><br>
The is a very cool feature in Visual Studio 2017 because this option helps to identify the exact open and close curly braces
<em>&quot;{}&quot;</em> through dotted line in our code. This dotted line is really helpful for when you are working on a bulk amount of code in a single page.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Filttered IntelliSense Search</h2>
<p><br>
The new Filtering IntelliSense Search option is available in Visual Studio 2017. This option is one of the powerful way to consume the search time in our code. The following IntelliSense bottom tray contains icons as Properties, Interface, Modules, Namespaces,
 Enums, Classes, Constants etc. For example, if i want to search an Interface, then I can choose an Interface Icon from the bottom of the tray, else it will show all the possible contents in our solution.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Improvements Of Navigation Controls</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to All ( Cntrl &#43; T ) </li><li>Go to Line ( Cntrl &#43; G ) </li><li>Go to File ( Cntrl &#43; 1 &#43; F ) </li><li>Go to Type ( Cntrl &#43; 1 &#43; T ) </li><li>Go to Member ( Cntrl &#43; 1 &#43; M ) </li><li>Go to Symbol ( Cntrl &#43; 1 &#43; S ) </li></ol>
<h2>Code suggestions</h2>
<p><br>
This is a very exciting feature in VS2017. It gives us the good code practice in our Application. The code given below notices that we have written an
<em>&quot;If&quot;</em> condition without curl braces. Thus, it gives us the suggestion tip add the curl braces to understand the code.<br>
